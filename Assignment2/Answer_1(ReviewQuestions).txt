Q1
	The two kinds of division are integer division, which discards any remainder, and floating-point division, which yields a floating-point result (with a fractional part, if necessary). Floating-point division is performed if either operand (or both) is floating-point (that is, if either number being operated on is floating-point); integer division is performed if both operands are integers.


Q2
	False is always represented by a zero value. Any nonzero value is considered true. The built-in operators <, <=, >, >=, ==, !=, &&, ||, and ! always generate 0 for false and 1 for true.


Q3
	Terminating declarations, terminating statements, and separating the three control expressions in a for loop.


Q4
	i = 0;
	while(i < 10)
		{
		printf("i is %d\n", i);
		i++;
		}


Q5
	1 (or "true"), because 3 is in fact less than 4.


Q6
	If T is greater than or equal to 32 and less than 212. (If you said ``greater than 32 and less than 212'', you weren't quite right, and this kind of distinction--paying attention to the difference between ``greater than'' and ``greater than or equal''--is often extremely important in programming.)


Q7
	It would print "yes", since x is nonzero.
